# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Code Agent when working with code in this repository.

**Always keep AGENTS.md updated with project status.**

## Fork changes vs upstream

This repo is a personal fork of `johnny-zhao/pi-agent-studio`. Everything listed here is a
deliberate divergence — **keep this the single source of truth** so upstream syncs stay small.
Each entry names the file and the reason, so a merge conflict is a two-line decision.

### 1. Delegate `subagent` to the external `pi-subagents` (2026-09-15)

- `package.json` → `pi-agent-studio.disabledTools.default` is now `["subagent"]` (upstream: `[]`).
- **Why**: pi hard-fails when two extensions register the same tool name. `resource-loader.js`
  `detectExtensionConflicts()` pushes the clash into `extensionsResult.errors`, and `main.js`
  does `if (hasRuntimeErrors) { …; process.exit(1) }` with **no mode check** — so TUI, `rpc`,
  `json` and `print` all die at startup. The bundled `bridge/subagent/index.ts` and the npm
  `pi-subagents` both register a tool named `subagent`, so upstream's default makes the
  extension unstartable on any machine that has `pi-subagents` installed.
  (Note: `runner.js`'s "first registration per name wins" only applies to paths that never
  reach the conflict detector — SDK custom tools, reload — not to cross-extension clashes.)
- **How it works**: `bridge/subagent/index.ts` reads `PI_VSCODE_DISABLED_TOOLS` and returns
  early when it contains `"subagent"`. That gate is **upstream code** — our change is only the
  default value. Users who want the bundled one back just clear the setting.
- **Verified**: `pi --mode rpc -e bridge/subagent/index.ts` → `exit 1`, never answers
  `get_state`; same command with `PI_VSCODE_DISABLED_TOOLS='["subagent"]'` → answers normally,
  and the tool description then shows pi-subagents' contract (`{action:"list",capabilities:true}`)
  instead of `{agent, task}`.
- **Companion setup (user-level, lives outside this repo)**: `explore` and `general` exist as
  **pi-subagents-native agent definitions** — real files in `~/.pi/agent/agents/`, not symlinks.
  They were re-authored from the bundled `bridge/agents/*.md` bodies but use pi-subagents'
  frontmatter vocabulary, which buys two things the originals lacked:
  - `explore` — `tools: read, grep, find, ls, bash`, `thinking: low`, `systemPromptMode: replace`.
    The bundled version only had `read, bash`, so searching meant shelling out to `bash grep`.
  - `general` — `tools: read, grep, find, ls, bash, edit, write`, `systemPromptMode: append`.
    `append` is deliberate: the bundled `general.md` had an **empty body**, i.e. it only ever
    extended the parent prompt and never replaced it, so `append` reproduces that behaviour.
    **Verified**: `subagent {action:"list",capabilities:true}` reports them under `User agents` as
    `- explore (user): … Tools: read, grep, find, ls, bash; Thinking: low` and
    `- general (user): … Tools: read, grep, find, ls, bash, edit, write`.
- `bridge/agents/{explore,general}.md` is now **reference-only**: with `disabledTools` defaulting
  to `["subagent"]` nothing loads it. It is kept to keep the upstream diff small, and as the
  source the user-level definitions above were derived from. If upstream edits these files,
  decide by hand whether to fold the change into the user-level copies.

### 2. `pi-chat/src/messages.ts` tolerates pi-subagents' result shape

- `isFailedSubagent()` additionally treats `error` / `interrupted` / `timedOut` as failure.
- `renderAgentBody()` reads `r.errorMessage || r.error`.
- **Why**: pi-subagents' `SingleResult` signals failures through `error`, not pi's
  `stopReason` / `errorMessage`. Everything else already lines up — `details.results[]`,
  `agent`, `task`, `exitCode`, `messages`, `model`, and the entire `Usage` shape (including a
  numeric `cost`, so `cost.toFixed()` is safe). These two lines are the only real gap;
  without them subagent errors render silently.

### 3. Sidebar trimmed to the chat panel only

- `package.json` drops the `pi` activity container; `src/extension.ts` drops the
  `pi-agent-studio.sessions` / `.settings` view providers; `pi-agent-studio.ui` defaults to
  `sidebar`. Details under "Sidebar views" below. `src/sessions/sessions-sidebar.ts` and
  `src/settings/settings-sidebar.ts` remain in source as dormant modules.

### 4. Settings "Agents" tab no longer claims a built-in source

- `src/settings/settings-panel.ts` → `getBuiltinAgentsDir()` returns
  `<extension>/bridge/agents.retired` (a path that never exists) instead of `bridge/agents`.
- **Why**: with `disabledTools` defaulting to `["subagent"]`, `bridge/agents/` feeds no live
  agent. Leaving it wired up made the Agents tab tag `explore` / `general` as "built-in" (they
  are now user-level pi-subagents definitions) and made `isBuiltinName()` **reject creating an
  agent with those names** in user / project scope — a dead-end, since the user-level copies are
  the live ones.
- `loadAgentsFromDir()` already returns `[]` for a missing directory, so this degrades cleanly
  and `listAgents()` simply lists project / user entries.
- `README.md` / `README.zh-CN.md` were also corrected to state that the bundled `subagent` tool
  is disabled by default and the tool is supplied by pi-subagents.

### 5. Composer controls stay visible in narrow sidebars

- `pi-chat/src/style.css` → dropped the `@media (max-width: 640px)` / `(max-width: 420px)` rules
  that hid `.permission-wrap` / `.model-wrap` / `.thinking-wrap`; replaced with
  `min-width: 0; flex-shrink: 1` on `.composer-controls-bar > .select-wrap`, plus
  `flex-shrink: 0` on `.composer-controls-bar > .icon-btn`.
- **Why**: the VS Code sidebar defaults to roughly 300px — i.e. under **both** breakpoints — so
  the model / thinking / permission pickers were invisible in the primary UI of this fork
  (sidebar-only chat). It only looked fine in the editor-area panel, which is wide. The bar's
  minimum footprint is ~230px and every control already truncates its own label with an
  ellipsis, so shrinking is enough.
- **Verified**: built bundle has zero occurrences of the old hide rules and ≥1 of the new one.

### 6. Taller composer input

- `pi-chat/src/style.css` → `#input` `min-height: 28px` → `40px`, `padding: 8px 10px 2px` →
  `10px 10px 4px`.
- `pi-chat/src/composer.ts` → the height floor in `autoGrow()`, `Math.max(28, …)` → `Math.max(40, …)`.
- **Why**: 28px read as cramped in the narrow sidebar composer.
- **These two values must stay in sync.** The CSS `min-height` wins over the inline `height`
  that `autoGrow()` sets, so a mismatch is silent — it still renders correctly, but reads as a bug.

### 7. MCP config panel points at `pi-mcp-adapter`

- `src/mcp/mcp-config.ts` → `getMcpUserPath()` returns `~/.agents/mcp.json` (was
  `<agentDir>/mcp.json`); `getMcpProjectPath()` returns `<folder>/.mcp.json` (was
  `<folder>/.pi/mcp.json`). `updateServer()` **merges** (`{...existing, ...entry}`) instead of
  replacing the whole entry.
- `src/chat/chat-session.ts` → the `mcpOpen` case no longer gates on
  `pi-agent-studio.mcp.enabled` before sending `/mcp status`.
- **Why**: MCP is served by the external `pi-mcp-adapter`, never by the bundled `pi-mcp`
  (`mcp.enabled` defaults to `false`, so the bundled extension is not even injected). But the
  Settings panel and the chat drawer still read/wrote the **bundled** extension's config path, so
  anything configured there silently had no effect — and `mcpOpen` claimed "MCP is disabled"
  while the adapter was running fine. `/mcp status` and `/mcp <action> <server>` are adapter
  syntax, so the chat side now passes straight through.
- **Merge vs replace is load-bearing**: adapter entries carry fields the panel's form does not
  model (`auth`, `oauth`, `protocolVersion`, `includeTools`). A wholesale replace dropped them on
  every edit.
- **Known limits** (accepted, not bugs):
  - The panel can only see/write the fields in `ServerEntry`; adapter-only fields need a manual
    JSON edit.
  - Connection status, reconnect and OAuth live only in `/mcp`'s overlay, which the adapter
    itself restricts to `ctx.mode === "tui"` — so it needs a real terminal.
  - The chat MCP drawer no longer auto-opens: it was driven by the structured `mcpStatus`
    payload, a `pi-mcp` protocol the adapter does not speak. Clicking the toolbar icon now just
    posts `/mcp status`, which arrives as a multi-line toast (`.toast` has `white-space: pre-wrap`,
    so it renders fine).

### Left alone on purpose (dormant, zero runtime effect)

Keeping these means the upstream diff stays small; none of them execute any more.

- `bridge/subagent/**` (index.ts / agents.ts / README) and `bridge/agents/**` (explore.md /
  general.md) — still packed by `.vscodeignore`'s `!bridge/**`, but `disabledTools` keeps the
  extension from registering, so nothing loads them. `bridge/agents/*.md` is kept as the source
  the user-level definitions were derived from.
- `src/constants.ts` → `SUBAGENT_EXTENSION_PATH` / `BUILTIN_AGENTS_DIR`, and the matching
  `-e` / `PI_VSCODE_BUILTIN_AGENTS_DIR` injection in `src/pi.ts` (`:159`, `:203`, `:223`).
  The env var now has no consumer; the `-e` path still loads the extension, which is what makes
  the `disabledTools` gate effective.
- `pi-chat`'s `subagent` rendering (`messages.ts`, `style.css`, `globals.ts`) — **shared, not
  ours**: pi-subagents returns results under the same `subagent` tool name, so this code renders
  its output too. It must stay.

## Build & Run

- pnpm workspace: root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` declares `pi-chat`, **`pi-mcp`** and **`pi-settings`** as members; **single root `pnpm-lock.yaml`** (no lockfile/workspace file inside `pi-chat/`, `pi-mcp/` or `pi-settings/`). Builds use `pnpm --filter <pkg> ...` (e.g. `build`), not `--dir`. `onlyBuiltDependencies: [esbuild]` lives in the root `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- `pnpm build` — `pnpm --filter pi-chat build` (vite + model-icons extract) **then** `pnpm --filter pi-mcp build` (rolldown → `bridge/mcp/index.js`) **then** `pnpm --filter pi-settings build` (vite singlefile → `src/settings/settings-dist.html`) **then** `rolldown -c rolldown.config.ts` (code splitting: `dist/extension.cjs` ~24 KB main entry + `dist/chunks/*.cjs` lazy-loaded via `await import()` on first use; `.vscodeignore` whitelists only `dist/chunks/**/*.cjs`, excluding `*.map`). `pnpm dev` watches **only** the rolldown bundle; pi-chat/pi-mcp/pi-settings source changes are NOT picked up — run the relevant `pnpm --filter <pkg> build` separately.
- `pnpm fmt` (auto-fix) / `pnpm lint` / `pnpm typecheck` — oxlint + oxfmt, oxfmt --check, and `tsgo` (TypeScript Native Preview, NOT `tsc`). The `pi-mcp`, `pi-chat` and `pi-settings` subpackages each have their own `tsc --noEmit` typecheck (`pnpm --filter pi-mcp typecheck`, `pnpm --filter pi-chat typecheck`, `pnpm --filter pi-settings typecheck`); bridge TS is covered by `tsconfig.bridge.json`, run as part of `pnpm typecheck` (see below).
- `pnpm test` — runs `lint && typecheck` only. **`vitest` is not wired in**; run directly: `pnpm vitest run` or a single file: `pnpm vitest run test/resolve.test.ts`.
- Bridge extensions (`bridge/**/*.ts`) are covered by `pnpm typecheck` via the committed `tsconfig.bridge.json` (`./typecheck.sh [bridge/foo.ts]` for single-file iteration). The config resolves `@earendil-works/pi-tui` / `pi-agent-core` / `typebox` through `paths` to `pi-mcp/node_modules` (pi-mcp declares the same pi versions as devDependencies); `pi-coding-agent` / `pi-ai` (incl. the `pi-ai/compat` subpath) resolve from the root `node_modules` normally. No `npm root -g`, no `npx tsc`, no generated throwaway tsconfig. See `pi-extension-typecheck.md`.
- `pnpm package` (builds + `vsce package --no-dependencies`), `pnpm install-local` (package + install `.vsix` into local VS Code).
- `pnpm release [major|minor|patch]` — bumps `package.json`, packages, commits, tags, pushes (CI publishes). Add `--local` to publish via `vsce`/`ovsx` from the dev machine.
- Always run `pnpm fmt` **and** `pnpm typecheck` before finalizing changes.

## Architecture Overview

Three cooperating pieces, no framework:

1. **VS Code extension host** (`src/extension.ts` → `dist/extension.cjs`) — Activates `onStartupFinished`, registers commands/views/status bar, owns the local bridge lifecycle.
2. **Local HTTP bridge** (`src/bridge/*`) — `createBridge` boots a localhost server with a per-session auth token. URL+token are injected as `PI_VSCODE_BRIDGE_URL` / `PI_VSCODE_BRIDGE_TOKEN` env vars into every pi launch, alongside a per-terminal `PI_VSCODE_TERMINAL_ID`. Handlers serve RPC calls for editor state, diagnostics, symbols, definitions, hovers, references, code actions, formatting, and workspace edits. The endpoint is configurable via `pi-agent-studio.bridgeSocket` (`src/bridge/endpoint.ts` + `bind.ts`): empty = random port (default), a number = fixed TCP port (falls back to random + warning when busy), anything else = Unix socket path / Windows named pipe with `{windowId}` substitution (stale-socket unlink retry; `0600` perms). Changes hot-restart the bridge and offer a "Restart Pi Terminals" action (`sessions.restartAll`); already-running pi processes keep the old endpoint until recreated (env is frozen at spawn).
3. **Bundled pi extensions** — **eight**, loaded via repeated `--extension` (paths in `src/constants.ts`): `pi-vscode-bridge.js` (vscode\_\* tools + TUI footer status), `todo.ts`, `questionnaire.ts`, `subagent/index.ts` (spawns separate `pi` processes per invocation, JSON mode; max 8 parallel/4 concurrent), `btw.ts` (`/btw` quick-question command, not an LLM tool), `permission-gate.ts`, `rewind-code.ts`, `mcp/index.js` (MCP servers bridge — tools/resources/prompts; see below).

Terminal launch flow (`src/terminal.ts` + `src/pi.ts`):

- Pi is spawned **directly** by VS Code's terminal: `shellPath = piPath`, `shellArgs = piArgs`. `pi-agent-studio.path` must point at whatever pi shim works in your environment (on Windows nvm4w/npm, `pi.cmd` via cmd, `pi.ps1` via PowerShell — both fine).
- For short-lived child processes (`pi --version` in `settings-env.ts`, package-manager probes in `upgrade.ts`), use plain `execFile(piPath, args, ...)` — on Windows it runs `.cmd`/`.bat` via cmd internally, no manual shell wrapping.
- User extra args (`pi-agent-studio.args`) and user env (`pi-agent-studio.env`) are merged in; bridge env wins on key collision.
- `PI_VSCODE_DISABLED_TOOLS` (JSON list) gates the `vscode_*` tools **and** `todo`/`questionnaire`/`subagent` — each extension reads the env var and checks its own name itself (env absent ⇒ enabled, keeping the files reusable in plain pi). `btw` is NOT gateable (command, not tool).

Session restoration (`src/sessions.ts` + `session-status-registry.ts`):

- On `session_start`, the bundled bridge RPCs `reportTerminalSession({terminalId, sessionFile})`. The tracker persists `{terminalId → sessionFile}` to `workspaceState["pi-agent-studio.terminalSessions"]`.
- On activation, stored entries whose `sessionFile` still exists are relaunched with `--session <sessionFile>`. Terminals closed by the user (non-`Shutdown` exit reason) and missing-on-disk entries are pruned. `session-status-registry.ts` keeps a shared running/idle status map that both terminal and chat sources upsert into (powers sidebar indicators; `onClose` removes entries).
- The tracker keeps an in-memory `terminalsById` so the Sessions sidebar can **reuse** an already-open terminal instead of spawning a duplicate. Sidebar `+` button delegates to `pi-agent-studio.open` for blank-session creation.

CJS wrapper pattern: source is ESM (`"type": "module"`), bundled by rolldown → `dist/extension.cjs` (CJS, `external: vscode`, minified). VS Code's `require()` loader needs CJS output; `?raw` imports are inlined by `rawPlugin` in `rolldown.config.ts`.

Sidebar views — a **single** webview under the `pi-chat` activity container.

**Fork change (this repo):** the upstream `pi` activity container was removed — `package.json` no longer declares it and `extension.ts` no longer registers the `pi-agent-studio.sessions` / `pi-agent-studio.settings` view providers. `pi-agent-studio.ui` now defaults to `sidebar`. Their modules remain in source as **dormant** code (like `src/packages.ts`) — do not assume they are registered. Settings stay reachable via the `pi-agent-studio.openSettings` command (editor-area panel); the first-run onboarding card that lived in the settings sidebar is dormant with it.

- **Sessions (dormant)** (`src/sessions/sessions-sidebar.ts`) — no longer registered. The session _tracker_ is still live: `createSessionTracker` (`src/sessions.ts`) powers terminal session restore and `sessions.restore()` in `activate()`, and `chat-tracker.ts` still restores webview chat panels when `ui == "webview"`.
- **Settings (dormant)** (`src/settings/settings-sidebar.ts`) — no longer registered (kept for upstream diffing). Was: env info, links, `Upgrade Pi` button, and a "Full Settings" jump button (opens the pi-settings panel via `pi-agent-studio.openSettings`). No config editing here anymore. Default `visibility: collapsed`. The Node version shown comes from a single unified PATH-level probe (`detectSystemNodeEnv` in `settings-env.ts` — `node --version`/`npm --version` via `execOnPath`, npm needs cmd.exe shim wrapping on Windows; do NOT fall back to `process.version`, it returns VS Code's bundled Node, e.g. v24, misleading nvm users). **First-run onboarding card** (`#onboarding-host` in `settings-sidebar-html.ts`): every `postData` runs `detectSystemNodeEnv` once and ships `envCheck` (node/npm/npmSupported) + `platform` messages. The card renders only when pi is missing: check items (Node ≥ 22.19.0 via `isNodeVersionSupported` in `node-version.ts` — a pure module so vitest can import it, unlike settings-env.ts which pulls in `vscode`), link-only install steps (nodejs.org / pi.dev, no bundled scripts, no command text), a Windows Git Bash hint, and a "restart VS Code" verify hint (PATH changes only apply on VS Code restart). Once pi + node + npm all pass it switches to a next-steps checklist whose buttons post `openSettings {tab}` (`pi-agent-studio.openSettings` accepts an optional tab arg; `openSettingsPanel(uri, initialTab?)` + `setTab` message in `pi-settings/src/main.ts`) or `openVscodeSettings {query}` (`workbench.action.openSettings`). Card is not closable.
- **Chat (sidebar)** (`src/chat/chat-sidebar.ts`, view id `pi-agent-studio.chatSidebar` in its own `pi-chat` activity bar container, separate from the Pi sessions/settings container) — WebviewView hosting the same full `pi-chat` UI via `getChatWebviewHtml`; `retainContextWhenHidden: true` keeps the webview alive while hidden. **No RPC process is spawned until the user explicitly starts the chat**: the view resolves to a lightweight starter screen (`getStarterHtml`, self-contained CSP + `startSession` button) and `Pi: Open in Sidebar` (`pi-agent-studio.openInSidebar`, focuses the `pi-chat` container + view) is the other way to start — `startSidebarSession` then swaps in the real chat HTML and attaches. **Single background session per window**, deduped through a module-level `pendingSession` promise so concurrent starter-click + command calls spawn only one pi process. No `ChatTracker` persistence (session dies with VS Code, no restore). `openSidebarChat` accepts an optional `sessionFile` (switch to that session: same → focus, different → native modal confirm + `session.switchTo()`) or `newSession: true` (`session.newSession()` in place), both streaming-guarded. Closing/hiding the view does NOT kill the RPC child — `resolveWebviewView` re-attaches the same module-level singleton session (`sidebarState`) to the fresh webview (re-hydrate = full state re-post); `disposeSidebarChat()` kills it on `deactivate()`. On language/mermaid-theme changes the html is regenerated (starter or chat, whichever is active) and the session re-attached.

### Full Settings panel (`src/settings/` + `pi-settings/`)

`pi-agent-studio.openSettings` (command + sidebar jump button) opens a **single-instance editor-area WebviewPanel** (`settings-panel.ts`, `ViewColumn.Beside`, `retainContextWhenHidden: true`, no persistence) hosting the full config UI as a **Vite subproject** (`pi-settings/`) — same pattern as `pi-chat/`: `pnpm --filter pi-settings build` → vite singlefile → `copy-dist.mjs` → `src/settings/settings-dist.html` (gitignored), inlined via `import settingsHtml from "./settings-dist.html?raw"` (`settings-webview.ts`). Seven tabs, **data loaded lazily per tab** (`tabLoad` message → `buildTabData` → `tabData` reply):

- **Models** — Three subtabs: Providers (CRUD over `~/.pi/agent/models.json` via `models-config.ts`), OAuth (`oauth-flow.ts` token/promise flow; `oauthProgress` events rendered in-tab), API Keys (`auth-config.ts`). `buildTabData` awaits `refreshModelRegistry()` + `getOAuthProviderStatuses()` + `getApiKeyProviderStatuses()`.
- **Agents** — CRUD over builtin `bridge/agents/*.md`, user `~/.pi/agent/agents`, project `.pi/agents` (`agents-config.ts`); model dropdown from `getModelRuntime().getAvailable()`.
- **Prompt Templates** / **Skills** — Listed via `DefaultResourceLoader` (per-tab `noX` flags), written via `prompts-config.ts` / `skills-config.ts`.
- **MCP Servers** — Server config CRUD, user/project scope (`mcp-config.ts`); form fields serialized by `parseServerEntry`. Live connections are owned by the MCP bridge extension, not this panel.
- **Commit Message** — Writes VS Code settings `pi-agent-studio.commitModel` / `commitLanguage` / `commitMessagePrompt` via `ConfigurationTarget.Global`; model dropdown from `getAvailableAgentModels()`.
- **Settings** — System prompt Append/Override textareas only (`~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` / `SYSTEM.md` via `settings-config.ts`).

All CRUD handlers live in `settings-panel.ts` and **top-level static import** the config modules (`models-config.ts`, `auth-config.ts`, `oauth-flow.ts`, `agents-config.ts`, `prompts-config.ts`, `skills-config.ts`, `mcp-config.ts`) — safe because `settings-panel.ts` itself is `await import()`ed from `extension.ts`, so its dependency tree lands in the `settings-panel-*.cjs` chunk, not the ~24 KB main entry. The `pi-settings` UI keeps its **own codicon subset** in `pi-settings/src/style.css` (same rule as pi-chat). Note: `updateProvider`/`renameProviderAndUpdate` use null-sentinel sanitization (`sanitizeUpdates`/`sanitizeModelUpdates`), and `startOAuthFlow` is synchronous (returns a controller; callbacks via `onProgress`).

- Packages sidebar (`src/packages.ts`) exists in source but is **not** registered in `package.json` views — dormant; verify before referencing.

Other extension-host features:

- **Git commit messages** (`src/gitCommit/`) — SCM title button "Generate Commit Message with Pi". Uses pi SDK `createAgentSession` + git CLI (`gitUtils.ts`); configurable via `commitModel` (`provider/model` pattern), `commitLanguage`, `commitMessagePrompt`; diff truncated at 64KB. Abort via `abortCommitGeneration` (sets `pi-agent-studio.isGeneratingCommit` context).

### Webview chat mode (`src/chat/` + `pi-chat/`)

`pi-agent-studio.ui` accepts three values (`terminal` / `webview` / `sidebar`), resolved via `resolveUiMode()` in `src/ui-mode.ts` (unknown values fall back to `terminal`). **This fork defaults to `sidebar`** (upstream shipped `terminal`). When `ui == "webview"`, `Pi: Open` / `Open Here` open a **WebviewPanel** (`openChatPanel` in `chat-panel.ts`), spawning a `pi --mode rpc` subprocess **per panel** (`src/chat/rpc-client.ts`) over JSONL (strict LF framing, no `readline`). `openChatPanel` accepts an optional `cwd` (spawn working dir; toolbar shows `{shortened-cwd} ({git-branch}) • {sessionName}`, branch fetched once via `getGitBranch` in `gitUtils.ts`, detached HEAD omitted). When `ui == "sidebar"`, `Pi: Open`/Sessions entries route to `openSidebarChat`; `Open in New Window` is hidden in the command palette (`config.pi-agent-studio.ui != sidebar`) and early-returns in code.

**Shared session controller** (`src/chat/chat-session.ts`): `createChatSession(options)` owns the RPC subprocess and ALL webview<->extension message handling (the big `onMessage` switch: prompt/abort/copy/openFile/setModel/toggleFavorite/setThinking/setSessionName/pickResource/searchFiles/fork/revert/dialogResponse/reload/todoClear/openSettings/mcpOpen/mcpAction/setPermission/btwAbort/rewind\*/rewindDiff; plus `handleExtUiRequest`, `handleBuiltin`, `hydrate`, `applySessionFile`, context-usage stat requests). The host is abstracted as `ChatHost` (`postMessage` / `onDidReceiveMessage` / `onDidDispose` / optional `updateTitle`); host-specific callbacks are `onSessionFile` (panel: `ChatTracker.update` + `sessionToPanel` + `sessionStatusRegistry`), `onStreamingChange`, `onExit`. `session.attach(host)` re-binds to a new webview and re-hydrates full state (used by the sidebar on re-resolve / language reload). `ChatSession` also exposes `switchTo(sessionFile)` and `newSession()` (streaming-guarded, reuse the RPC subprocess; both funnel through the `refreshAfterSwitch()` helper to re-pull state/messages + `applySessionFile`). A module-level `allSessions` set powers the `toggleFavorite` broadcast across all panels + sidebar. `resolveChatBackground` moved to `chat-webview.ts` (shared html/background helpers).

**Webview built-in commands** (`src/chat/builtin-commands.ts` + `chat-session.ts` `handleBuiltin`): the webview has its own set of "built-in" slash commands implemented in the extension host, NOT via `pi.registerCommand()` — `BUILTIN_COMMAND_NAMES` (`compact`, `autocompact`, `session`, `name`, `changelog`, `clear`, `new`, `reload`) gates `parseBuiltin()`, and `handleBuiltin()` switches on the parsed name to act directly (or post `state`/`messages`/exceptions back). `mergeBuiltinCommands()` prepends `builtinCommands()` to `rpc.getCommands()` results (de-duped, then sorted) so they appear in the chat slash-command list; `HIDDEN_COMMAND_NAMES` excludes internal commands (`todo-clear`, `pi-vscode-tree`, `rewind-*`) from that list. Because these never go through the pi extension command registry, terminal mode is unaffected and cannot hit the builtin-interactive-command name-collision warning. Add webview-only slash commands here, never as a bridge `pi.registerCommand()`.

The chat UI is a **Vite subproject** (`pi-chat/`), not inline TS: `pnpm --filter pi-chat build` runs `extract-model-icons.mjs` (generates gitignored `pi-chat/src/model-icons-data.ts` from `@lobehub/icons`) then vite singlefile build; `copy-dist.mjs` copies the result to `src/chat/chat-dist.html` (gitignored), which the extension inlines via `import chatHtml from "./chat-dist.html?raw"` (`chat-webview.ts`). Both generated files are gitignored — a fresh clone must run `pnpm build` before chat code typechecks/works, and webview UI changes require the pi-chat build step (not just rolldown) to take effect.

RPC-mode UI wiring (`chat-session.ts` `handleExtUiRequest`): `select`/`confirm`/`input`/`editor` extension UI requests are forwarded to the webview as `dialog` (questionnaire; `btw` abort confirm is special-cased via `BTW_ABORT_TITLE`), `setWidget` is forwarded with `widgetKey` + `widgetLines` (todo list, btw answer card, rewind accept/revert — rendered in `pi-chat/src/composer.ts` / `rewind.ts`), `notify` becomes a toast, unless the message starts with `__mcp_status__` (MCP bridge status JSON - intercepted and forwarded as `mcpStatus` to the webview drawer instead of a toast). Other fire-and-forget methods (`setStatus`, `setTitle`) are ignored. Clear-button and accept/revert interactions post `todoClear` / `rewindAccept` back, which call `rpc.prompt("/todo-clear", streaming ? "steer" : undefined)` etc. In TUI mode the same extensions use `ctx.ui.setWidget` with component factories; in RPC mode plain string lines only (component factories unsupported).

Session persistence: `ChatTracker` (`chat-tracker.ts`) writes `workspaceState["pi-agent-studio.chatSessions"]` = `{panelId -> sessionFile}`. Restore reopens panels with `--session <file>` (falling back to `switch_session` if `get_state` shows the wrong session) and re-hydrates via `get_messages`. `sessionFile` is captured from `get_state` right after spawn and re-checked on `agent_settled` (it may be null until the first turn). Panels are tracked in `activePanels` / `sessionToPanel` so reopening focuses the existing panel; `disposeAllChatPanels()` runs on `deactivate()`; each panel kills its RPC child (`taskkill /T /F` on Windows). `retainContextWhenHidden: true` preserves streaming/scroll state across tab switches.

### i18n (en + zh-cn, `pi-agent-studio.language`)

Three independent mechanisms, all keyed by **source string as key** (`t("Open Pi Settings")`), `{0}`/`{1}` placeholders, fallback chain bundle → key:

1. **package.json contributes** — `package.nls.json` + `package.nls.zh-cn.json` via the standard `%key%` mechanism (`"l10n": "./l10n"` field). Follows the VS Code display language; **cannot** be overridden by the setting.
2. **Extension host runtime** — `src/i18n.ts`: `t()`/`getLocale()`/`getWebviewI18n()`. Bundles are `l10n/bundle.l10n.json` (en, empty) + `l10n/bundle.l10n.zh-cn.json`, imported with `with { type: "json" }` import attributes (rolldown splits them into a sync-required `dist/chunks/i18n-*.cjs` chunk; `.vscodeignore` whitelists `l10n/**` + `package.nls*.json`). Locale = `auto` follows `vscode.env.language` (zh-cn/zh-hans → zh-cn), else explicit `en`/`zh-cn`. Changing the setting **reloads** open webviews (chat panels lose unsent drafts — accepted tradeoff); status bar tooltip refreshes in place.
3. **Webviews** — extension-host sidebars (sessions/settings) pre-translate static HTML via host `t()` and inject `window.__I18N__ = {lang, bundle}` + a client `t()` (supports `{0}`) for dynamic strings; Vite subprojects (`pi-chat/`, `pi-settings/`) each have their own `src/i18n.ts` + `src/locales/zh-cn.json` (JSON import, `resolveJsonModule` on in both tsconfigs), language injected by the host via `PI_LANG_PLACEHOLDER` replacement in `index.html` (`window.__PI_LANG__`), not via postMessage.

Not translated (kept English): bridge extensions (`bridge/**/*.ts`), `pi-mcp/`, LLM tool descriptions, `BRIDGE_BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT`, `pi-agent-studio.commitLanguage` (orthogonal), technical enum values (`stdio`/`http`/`sse`/`off`/`minimal`/`auto`), config keys, env var names, paths, placeholder example values.

## Critical Patterns

- **Pi binary resolution** (`src/_resolve.ts`): workspace `node_modules/.bin/pi` → known global dirs (`~/.bun/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `~/.npm-global/bin`; on Windows `%APPDATA%/npm`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%/pnpm`) → PATH → fallback `"pi"`. On Windows, **explicit `customPath` is respected as-is when the file exists** (e.g. an extensionless nvm4w bash shim must NOT be silently upgraded to `.cmd` — the shell layer would flip from git-bash to cmd.exe); only when missing do we probe `.exe` → `.cmd` → `.ps1`. Use `F_OK` not `X_OK` on Windows. `src/pi.ts` caches **both** the resolved path (`piPathCache`) and existence (`piExistsCache`); `invalidatePiBinaryCache()` clears both — wired to `onDidChangeConfiguration("pi-agent-studio.path")` and the post-install prompt branch.
- **Models Providers tab** uses event delegation with `data-action`/`data-id` (no inline `onclick` string concatenation — broke on dashes/quotes in ids). Renames combine with field updates into a single `renameProviderAndUpdate` message so they apply atomically. Empty-string fields are sent as `null` and converted to `undefined` so `JSON.stringify` drops them.
- **OAuth flow** (`src/models/oauth-flow.ts`) mirrors pi-web's `app/api/auth/login/[provider]/route.ts`: drives `AuthStorage.login()` with a shared memoized "manual input" request so `onAuth` / `onPrompt` / `onManualCodeInput` resolve the same promise. **Let `AuthStorage.login()` persist credentials itself** — do NOT write a placeholder credential afterwards (corrupts the SDK-managed entry).
- **Permission gate** (`bridge/permission-gate.ts`): gates bash commands via `AskForApproval`/`FullAccess` modes; config `pi-agent-studio.permission.mode` + `permission.dangerousPatterns` (case-insensitive regexes; user config fully replaces defaults). **Default pattern convention: option flags must be whitespace-anchored (`\s+-xxx`), never bare `.*-xxx`** — in-word matches like `chat-panel` or `auto-delete` would false-positive.
- **rewind-code** (`bridge/rewind-code.ts`): file-level sha256 snapshots stored under `~/.pi/snapshots/{sessionId}/{hash}` (no git dependency; deduped and aggregated by the owning user-message entryId). `/tree` rewind offers "message only" vs "message + code"; `/fork` rewind is message-only. `bash` in-place file edits are out of scope (no path in tool input) — notify the user they aren't covered. Widget maintains a per-file baseline ("last accept point"); Accept moves it forward, Revert restores the baseline snapshot; state resets on session compact.
- **MCP bridge** (`pi-mcp/` subpackage → `bridge/mcp/index.js`): a pnpm subpackage like `pi-chat/`, with the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` as a **dependency** — the SDK is **bundled/inlined** into `bridge/mcp/index.js` (rolldown externalizes only `@earendil-works/*` + `typebox`, which pi provides at runtime; `vsce package --no-dependencies` ships no `node_modules`). Source layout: `pi-mcp/src/{index,config,connection,tools,prompts,render,commands,types}.ts`. Loads config from `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` (user, via `getAgentDir`) + `<cwd>/.pi/mcp.json` (project; whole-server replacement on name collision). `MCP_EXTENSION_PATH` in `src/constants.ts`; injected via `-e` in `src/pi.ts` (`mcpExtensionArgs`) gated by `pi-agent-studio.mcp.enabled` (default `true`). On `session_start` it builds an `McpSession` and eagerly (non-blocking) connects each non-disabled server (stdio or StreamableHTTP→SSE fallback), discovers tools/resources/prompts, and registers **direct tools** named `mcp__<server>__<tool>` (inputSchema wrapped via `Type.Unsafe`), plus `mcp__<server>__list_resources`/`read_resource` and slash commands `/mcp__<server>__<prompt>` (result injected via `sendUserMessage`). `session_shutdown` disconnects all. Tools use `getSession()` indirection so they survive session switches without re-registration (module-level `currentSession` + a `registeredServers` Set dedup across switches). `/mcp [status|list|reconnect [server]|start <server>|stop <server>]` command. The chat-toolbar MCP button (`codicon-server`) no longer reconnects blindly - it posts `mcpOpen` -> host `rpc.prompt("/mcp status")` -> the command replies with a `__mcp_status__`-prefixed JSON `notify`; `chat-session.ts` `handleExtUiRequest` intercepts that marker (instead of toasting) and forwards `{type:"mcpStatus", servers}` to the webview, which opens a **bottom-sheet drawer** (`pi-chat/src/mcp-panel.ts`): per server a status dot (green=connected, blue=connecting, red=error/stopped, grey=disabled), a user/project source tag, a reconnect button, and a start/stop switch. The drawer is a **toolbar dropdown** (absolutely positioned just below `.toolbar` inside `.app`, with a translucent backdrop covering the message area - not the full-screen overlay), listing **all** configured servers (including config-`disabled` ones, which show as disabled/grey and can be runtime-started). `status()` returns every server with `source` (user/project) and `disabled` flags (config merged via `loadMergedServers`). Row actions post `mcpAction` {action:`reconnect`|`start`|`stop`, server} -> `rpc.prompt("/mcp <action> <server>")` -> command emits status JSON again -> drawer refreshes. Switch is runtime-only (disconnect/ensureConnected), not persisted to config. `start`/`reconnect` on a server whose tools were never registered (e.g. a config-`disabled` server started at runtime) calls `ensureServerRegistered` (deduped by `registeredServers`) to register its tools/prompts before activating. **Stopping a server also removes its `mcp__<server>__*` tools from pi's active-tool whitelist** via `pi.setActiveTools()` (runtime API since 0.83, in the type defs since 0.84; `getActiveTools()`/`setActiveTools()` rebuild the system prompt, taking effect on the next turn) so the tool definitions are no longer sent to the LLM - saving tokens. Tools stay registered in pi's registry (only deactivated); `start` re-adds them. `registerServerTools` records the full tool names on `McpConnection.registeredToolNames` for precise activate/deactivate (no prefix guessing, robust to sanitized names). Note: a fresh `session_start` re-evaluates config and reactivates all enabled servers, so a runtime stop does not persist across session switches.
- **pi-chat codicons are a manual subset** (`pi-chat/src/style.css`): the webview does NOT import `@vscode/codicons/dist/codicon.css`; `pi-chat/src/main.ts` injects only the `@font-face` for `codicon.ttf`. Each `.codicon-xxx::before { content: "\eXXX" }` glyph mapping is hand-defined in `style.css` — any new `codicon-xxx` class used in `pi-chat/` (HTML or TS-generated markup) needs its `::before` rule added (codepoint from `@vscode/codicons/dist/codicon.css`) or the icon renders blank. Currently defined: `discard, check, add, send, debug-stop, checklist, info, refresh, edit, copy, repo-forked, chevron-right, chevron-down, shield, unlock, clear-all, star-full, star-empty, server`. (Extension-host sidebars are unaffected — they get codicons from the VS Code runtime.)
- **pi-chat tooltips reuse the shared custom tooltip component** (`pi-chat/src/globals.ts`): hover hints on chat-webview buttons/rows must use `showTooltip(target, text)` + `hideTooltip()` (one shared `#ctxTooltip` element, 500 ms default delay) paired with an `aria-label`, never the native `title` attribute. Pattern: `el.addEventListener("mouseenter", () => showTooltip(el, t("..."))); el.addEventListener("mouseleave", hideTooltip);`.
- **Icon font** (`assets/fonts/pi-icons.woff2`): generated from `assets/logo.svg` with fantasticon; `contributes.icons.pi-logo.fontCharacter` in `package.json` must match the emitted glyph code in `assets/fonts/pi-icons.json`. Full rebuild instructions (incl. the counter-clockwise inner-hole winding requirement) in `.agents/docs/icons.md`.
- **Vitest suite is stale** (not wired into CI — `ci.yml` runs lint/typecheck/package only): `test/resolve.test.ts` `createPiGlobalInstallCommand` expectations still expect the old `--global …@latest` format, and `test/work-block-title.test.ts` imports `src/chat/chat-html.ts`, renamed to `chat-webview.ts` when the chat UI moved to the pi-chat subproject. Refresh these when touching `upgrade.ts` or the chat UI.
- **Lazy loading / code splitting** (`src/extension.ts` + `rolldown.config.ts`): the extension host bundle is **split** so activation stays fast. `dist/extension.cjs` (~24 KB) contains only `activate` essentials (bridge, session/chat trackers, terminal, command registration, the `lazyViewProvider` proxy). Everything else - the 8 sidebar providers, `chat-panel`+`chat-session`, `chat-sidebar`, `gitCommit`, `models-config`/`settings-config` - is loaded via `await import(...)` on first use, pulling the pi SDK + AI-provider implementations into separate `dist/chunks/*.cjs` only when a sidebar view resolves or a chat/commit command fires. Sidebar providers are wrapped by `lazyViewProvider()` (a proxy that dynamic-imports the real factory inside `resolveWebviewView`, memoized via a cached promise). Session/chat restore (`sessions.ts` / `chat-tracker.ts`) uses `Promise.all` over `fs/promises` `access` (parallel existence checks + parallel terminal/panel creation) instead of serial `existsSync` + serial `await`. `deactivate()` dynamic-imports `disposeAllChatPanels` + `disposeSidebarChat` (chat modules may never have loaded). When adding a new sidebar view or heavy command, register it through the same lazy pattern - do NOT add a top-level static `import` of the implementing module in `extension.ts`, or it re-enters the activation path and re-bloats the main chunk.
