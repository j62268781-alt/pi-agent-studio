## What this fork changes

Six deliberate divergences from upstream. Each is kept as small as possible so that syncing from
upstream stays cheap — the full rationale, exact file paths and verification notes for every one
live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) under **"Fork changes vs upstream"**.

| #   | Change                                                                                                                                                            | Why                                                                                                                            |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | **Delegates the `subagent` tool to the external [pi-subagents](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents)** — `pi-agent-studio.disabledTools` defaults to `["subagent"]` | Both extensions register a tool named `subagent`, and pi **exits 1** on that clash, so the bundled one has to yield             |
| 2   | **Chat panel understands pi-subagents' result shape** (`error` / `interrupted` / `timedOut` instead of `stopReason` / `errorMessage`)                              | Different failure signalling — without it, subagent errors render silently                                                      |
| 3   | **Sidebar shows only the chat panel** — the `pi` activity container and its sessions / settings views are gone, and `pi-agent-studio.ui` defaults to `sidebar`      | One panel, no redundant chrome                                                                                                  |
| 4   | **Settings → Agents stops claiming a built-in source**                                                                                                            | The bundled agents no longer load, so reporting them as built-in also blocked creating same-name agents                          |
| 5   | **Model / thinking-depth / permission pickers stay visible in narrow sidebars**                                                                                   | Upstream hid them below 640px / 420px — i.e. below the default ~300px sidebar, so all three vanished                             |
| 6   | **Taller composer input** (minimum 28px → 40px)                                                                                                                   | 28px read as cramped                                                                                                            |

### Companion setup (outside this repo)

`explore` and `general` ship here as **pi-subagents-native agent definitions**, re-authored from the
bundled `bridge/agents/*.md` with two upgrades: `explore` gains `grep` / `find` / `ls` (the bundled
version only had `read, bash`, so searching meant shelling out to `bash grep`) plus `thinking: low`;
`general` gains a short body and `systemPromptMode: append` (its bundled body was empty, i.e. it
only ever extended the parent prompt).

pi-subagents discovers agents in `~/.pi/agent/agents/`, so copy them there:

```bash
cp extras/agents/*.md ~/.pi/agent/agents/
```

## Features

- **Native terminal TUI** - Pi runs in a real VS Code integrated terminal (PTY). No shell layer, no quoting hacks - pi is spawned directly (default mode)
- **Webview chat panel** - Optional `webview` UI mode opens a streaming chat panel backed by a per-panel `pi --mode rpc` subprocess, with a rich `contenteditable` composer (`@file` mentions and `/commands` rendered as token chips), prompt queuing (Enter steer / Alt+Enter follow-up), input history, fork/revert, built-in commands, and retry
- **Sidebar chat view** — The same chat UI is also available as a **WebviewView** in its own **Pi Chat** activity bar container (`Pi: Open in Sidebar`): a lightweight starter screen shows until you start a session, and one background session per window survives view hide / re-resolve with full state re-hydration. A new `sidebar` value for `pi-agent-studio.ui` routes `Pi: Open` / `Open Here` and the Sessions view to it
- **Mermaid & math rendering** — The webview chat panel renders `mermaid` code fences as interactive diagrams and math expressions (`$...$`, `$$...$$`) with KaTeX; diagram theme is configurable via `pi-agent-studio.chatMermaidTheme` (`default` / `neutral` / `dark` / `forest` / `base`)
- **Rewind code** - Rewind a historical message in `/tree` and optionally restore the file changes too, via the bundled `rewind-code` extension (file-level snapshots, Accept / Revert controls; `/fork` rewind is message-only)
- **MCP support** - Talk to Model Context Protocol servers (stdio or HTTP) configured in user/project scope: discover and call their tools/resources via `mcp_tool_search` / `mcp_tool_call`, expose prompts as `/mcp__<server>__<prompt>` slash commands, and manage connections live from the chat toolbar drawer or the `/mcp` command (start / stop / reconnect, idle disconnect)
- **Skills management** - Visual panel to create, edit, and delete pi skills (SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter) in user and project scopes
- **VS Code bridge** — Bundles a pi extension and local HTTP bridge for live editor data
- **Diagnostics tool** — The agent can read VS Code diagnostics (LSP / lint / type errors) on demand via `vscode_get_diagnostics`
- **AI-powered Git commit messages** — Generate semantic commit messages from staged changes using pi, with support for 14 languages and custom prompt templates
- **Full Settings panel** — One unified webview editor for everything: Models (Providers / OAuth / API Keys), Agents, Prompt Templates, Skills, MCP Servers (stdio/http with a transport selector), **Commit Message** (model / language / custom prompt), and Settings (inline `settings.json` editor + System Prompt Append/Override) — all backed by direct `~/.pi/agent/*.json` I/O. The Models tab exposes **advanced provider/model compatibility options**: per-model API protocol and base URL overrides, custom headers with env/command placeholders, OpenAI/Anthropic compatibility fields, cost tiers, and thinking levels
- **Sidebar views** — `Sessions` (new/restore/switch) and a compact `Settings` sidebar (env info, upgrade, jump to the full panel)
- **Dangerous Command Approval** — Built-in permission gate that blocks dangerous bash commands like `rm -rf` and `sudo`, requiring manual approval before execution; supports `AskForApproval` / `FullAccess` modes and custom danger modes

## Requirements

- **VS Code ≥ 1.100.0** (the extension engine requirement is `^1.100.0`)
- `pi` CLI installed:

  ```bash
  npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
  # or
  bun add -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
  # or
  pnpm add -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
  # or
  yarn global add --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
  ```

- An API key (or OAuth credential) configured for at least one provider — manage them from the **Models** tab of the Settings panel

## Commands

| Command                              | Keybinding    | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Pi: Open`                           | `Alt+Shift+P` | Open or focus the pi terminal beside the editor                                                |
| `Pi: Open in New Window`             | —             | Open pi then move it to a new VS Code window                                                   |
| `Pi: Open in Sidebar`                | —             | Open the chat UI in the **Pi Chat** sidebar view (starter screen until a session is started)   |
| `Pi: Open Here`                      | —             | Open a pi terminal in the selected folder (via explorer context menu)                          |
| `Pi: Upgrade Pi`                     | —             | Upgrade pi via `pi update` (falls back to the inferred package manager when offline)           |
| `Pi: Open settings.json`             | —             | Open `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` in the editor (creates an empty `{}` if missing)              |
| `Pi: Open models.json`               | —             | Open `~/.pi/agent/models.json` in the editor (creates an empty `{ providers: {} }` if missing) |
| `Pi: Open Settings`                  | `Alt+Shift+,` | Open the full Settings panel (chat panel gear button and status bar item do the same)          |
| `Pi: Generate Commit Message`        | —             | Generate an AI-powered Git commit message from staged changes using pi                         |
| `Pi: Generate Commit Message - Stop` | —             | Abort an ongoing commit message generation                                                     |

The **Pi: Open** command is also wired to the editor title bar for one-click access.

## Sidebar

The **Pi** activity bar icon opens a sidebar with two webviews:

- **Sessions** - Per-workspace session list with live running/idle status icons; dropdown when multiple workspace folders exist
- **Settings** - Environment info, quick links, `Upgrade Pi` button, and a `Full Settings` jump button; when pi is missing it shows a first-run **onboarding card** with Node ≥ 22.19.0 / npm / pi checks, link-only install steps, and a restart hint (PATH changes apply on VS Code restart)
- **Pi Chat** - Activity bar icon hosts the chat UI as a sidebar webview (same UI as the webview chat panel). It shows a starter screen until you start a session via the button or `Pi: Open in Sidebar`, then keeps one background session per window that re-hydrates when the view is hidden and shown again.

### Full Settings panel

The **Settings** sidebar's jump button (or the `Pi: Open Settings` command) opens a single-instance editor panel with seven tabs, each loading its data lazily:

- **Models** — three subtabs:
  - **Providers** — Add / rename / edit / delete custom providers in `~/.pi/agent/models.json`; per-provider `authHeader` toggle and custom headers (env/command placeholders), per-model API protocol / base URL overrides, OpenAI / Anthropic compatibility fields, **sampling parameters**, cost tiers and thinking-level maps
  - **OAuth** — Sign in to providers that support OAuth, managed through the bundled `AuthStorage`
  - **API Keys** — Manage stored API keys in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`
- **Agents** - Manage user/project-level subagent definitions. **Fork note:** the bundled `subagent` tool is disabled by default (`pi-agent-studio.disabledTools`), so these definitions are consumed by the external [pi-subagents](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents) extension instead
- **Prompt Templates** - Create / edit / delete / open pi prompt templates (markdown with YAML frontmatter) in user and project scopes
- **Skills** - Create / edit / delete pi skills (SKILL.md) in user and project scopes; external skills are shown read-only with an option to open the file
- **MCP Servers** - Add / edit / delete MCP server configs in user (`~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`) and project (`.pi/mcp.json`) scopes, merged into a single deduplicated list with source badges; an explicit **transport selector** (stdio / http) shows only the relevant fields — command/args/env/cwd for stdio, url/headers/bearerToken for http — plus per-server `directTools` configuration
- **Commit Message** — Configure the AI-generated commit message feature: model (`provider/model`), output language, and a custom prompt template, written straight to VS Code settings
- **Settings** — Two sections:
  - **System Prompt** — **Append** → `~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` (appended to pi's system prompt), **Override** → `~/.pi/agent/SYSTEM.md` (replaces pi's system prompt entirely)
  - **settings.json** — Inline editor for `pi-agent-studio.*` configuration, saved directly to VS Code settings
  - **pi settings** — including TUI mode (`regular` / experimental `fullscreen`), fullscreen scrollbar, and Mermaid rendering mode (`off` / `final` / `streaming`)

## Bridge: tools, slash commands, and footer status

Each pi terminal launched by the extension loads a bundled pi extension that opens a local HTTP bridge to VS Code. The bridge powers three things:

1. **Live footer status** - Refreshed every ~1.5s in pi's TUI status area: active file, cursor / selection, language id, dirty marker, and diagnostic counts. Disable with `pi-agent-studio.statusBar`.
2. **One LLM tool** - The agent can autonomously read VS Code diagnostics. Other actions are intentionally **not** exposed to the model. Disable individual tools via `pi-agent-studio.disabledTools`.
3. **Slash commands** — User-triggered commands that pull live editor context and inject it into the conversation as a user message.

> **Design note.** Earlier versions exposed 25 tools to the model. They were cut down to one: tool-spam pollutes context and tempts the model into making file edits behind the editor's back. The remaining live-editor surface is now driven by **explicit slash commands** so the human stays in control of when context flows in.

### Bundled bridge extensions

Beyond the editor bridge, the extension bundles a few pi extensions that add agent-facing tools and commands (disable any via `pi-agent-studio.disabledTools`):

- **todo** - a `todo` LLM tool with a live list widget above the composer, plus `/todos` and `/todo-clear` commands
- **questionnaire** - lets the agent ask structured questions (rendered as a native web form in webview mode)
- **subagent** - **disabled by default in this fork** (`pi-agent-studio.disabledTools`); the `subagent` tool is provided by the external [pi-subagents](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents) extension instead, which ships `scout` / `worker` / `reviewer` / `oracle` and reads the same `~/.pi/agent/agents/` definitions managed from the **Agents** tab
- **permission-gate** - intercepts dangerous bash commands (matching `pi-agent-studio.permission.dangerousPatterns`, e.g. `rm -rf`, `sudo`) and requires approval before execution; switch per session via `/permission`
- **rewind-code** - file-level content snapshots that let you rewind a historical message via `/tree` and optionally restore its code changes (message-only on `/fork`); in the webview panel it drives a live changed-files widget with Accept / Revert
- **btw** - `/btw` asks a question without altering the main conversation context
- **mcp** - connects configured MCP servers (stdio or StreamableHTTP→SSE) at session start, registers their tools/prompts into pi, and powers the MCP server drawer in the chat toolbar (managed from the **MCP Servers** tab of the Settings panel; enable/disable via `pi-agent-studio.mcp.enabled`)

### LLM tool (1)

| Tool                     | What it returns                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vscode_get_diagnostics` | VS Code diagnostics (LSP / lint / type errors) for a file or the whole workspace |

Accepts an optional `filePath` (absolute or workspace-relative). With no argument it returns diagnostics for the whole workspace.

### Slash commands (2)

Type these inside the pi terminal. Each command resolves arguments from the **current VS Code state** when omitted, calls the bridge, and injects the JSON result back into the conversation as a user message (so the model sees it and can react).

| Command                                     | Arguments                           | Behavior                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/vscode-selection [intent?]`               | optional free-text intent           | Returns the current editor selection (text, file path, coordinates). Trailing text is treated as the user's intent and prepended to the injected message. |
| `/vscode-diagnostics [filePath?] [intent?]` | optional file path, optional intent | Returns diagnostics for `filePath`, or for the active editor when omitted. Non-path tokens are treated as intent.                                         |

Example:

```text
/vscode-selection explain this regex
/vscode-diagnostics src/extension.ts why is this failing?
/vscode-diagnostics                 # → diagnostics for the currently active editor
```

### Notes

- Slash command arguments use a simple heuristic: a token containing `/`, `\`, or `.` is treated as a file path; everything else is treated as free-text intent.
- File paths can be absolute or workspace-relative.
- The bridge RPC layer (`src/bridge/handlers.ts`) still implements the full set of editor operations (selection, symbols, definitions, references, hover, code actions, formatting, workspace edits, save, notifications, …). They are reachable from the bundled bridge but **not** registered as LLM tools or slash commands today — reserved for future explicit commands.
- Oversized bridge results are capped; when a response exceeds the limit, the tool returns a valid JSON wrapper with `truncated: true`, original size metadata, and a `resultJsonPrefix` preview.
